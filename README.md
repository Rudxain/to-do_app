# to-do_app
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) learning project. Inspired by ["ToDo List - Vanilla JavaScript"](https://youtu.be/DEbNCqe2e2U) by [@bluuweb](https://github.com/bluuweb).

## Usage
**Don't.** This is not meant for production. It's just for the sake of learning.

If you're a dev, I recommend you to learn and take inspiration from my code.

If you're a user... I have no idea why would you use this app, since there are much better ones, everywhere. My app has no search functionality, but I'm considering to implement it.

> [!WARNING]
> Beware of shared storage!
>
> HTML-Preview seems to allow pages to access each others' local/session storage. So don't save sensitive info while using the app

## Why
The previously-mentioned video is one of the courses that [CIC](https://cincinnatus.edu.do) lists in the specialization of Software Development.

I didn't like how Bluu implemented it, so I did my own variation of it.

I'm sharing it publicly for other future devs who might need this sort of learning material.
